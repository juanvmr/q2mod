# Example of .lircrc file for controlling Q2PRO.
#
# Commands prefixed with @ simulate Quake 2 keypresses,
# and are useful for menu navigation. Commands without @ prefix
# are just executed directly as if typed manually at the console.
#
# Config example below is already useful for some simple MVD
# playback or GTV watching, just replace mceusb with your remote
# contol name and fix the button names.
